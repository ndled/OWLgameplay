# OWLgameplay

This is a silly project that started with me and my brothers watching overwatch league matches and complaining about how terrible the casters are at filling time. I was looking for a new data science personal project and figured why not try and solve our problem with machine learning. In this notebook, I've written a convolutiuon neurel network to identify gameplay and skip all other parts of the match. It actually works pretty well. here is a link to me rambling about my process for the first version I put up on github

You will find the jupyter notebook I used while developing this as well as a command line tool for automation purposes.
